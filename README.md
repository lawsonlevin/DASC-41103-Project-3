# DASC-41103-Project-3

This repository contains the work of two undergraduate Data Science students from the University of Arkansas:
- Lawson Levin
- Alex Castronovo

Download the code file - 'project2.ipynb' along with the two data files: 'project_adult.csv' , 'project_validation_inputs.csv'

When executing the notebook on your machine, ensure the following lines contain the correct path to the appropriate csv file.

In Block 4
- df = pd.read_csv("/Users/lawsonlevin/ML/project1/data/project_adult.csv")

In Block 5
- new_data = pd.read_csv("project1/data/project_validation_inputs.csv")
